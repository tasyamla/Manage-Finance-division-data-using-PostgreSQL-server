# Financial Data Management System
---
This repository contains the code  for a financial data management system designed to help the Finance division organize and manage their data effectively. The focus of this project is on handling daily revenue, profit per product, segmentation, and country-specific data.

# Overview
The Finance division requires a robust system to manage and analyze financial data. This project aims to create a structured and normalized database using PostgreSQL to handle daily revenue and profit information, along with segmentation and country-specific data. The data undergoes exploration, cleaning, normalization, and is eventually structured into a relational database.

# Dataset

The dataset includes daily records of:

- Revenue and profit per product
- Product segmentation
- Country-specific data

The data is initially raw and requires cleaning and normalization before being incorporated into the database.

# Objective
- Able to create databases in PostgreSQL (DDL)
- Able to create tables with queries (DDL)
- Able to fill data into a table (DML)
- Able to apply transactional to queries (TCL)
    - a. Create at least 2 users with their usernames and passwords
    - b. Provide query access only for SELECT commands to one user and block INSERT, UPDATE, TRUNCATE and DELETE access specifically for the database that has been created. Other users can be considered as admins so give them all query command access.
- Able to provide query access to created databases (DCL)
- Able to process data before transferring to SQL database with Pandas
- Able to retrieve data from created databases (DQL)
    - a. Find information about the total profit obtained in each type of  segmentation and do not take data that is not discounted
    - b. Find information about statistical summaries that contain the average, min, and max values of Sales in each country.
